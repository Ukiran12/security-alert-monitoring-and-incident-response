# 🛡️ SOC Internship Task: Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response Simulation

## 📌 About the Project
This project is part of my **Security Operations Center (SOC) Internship** where I simulated the core activities of a SOC analyst. The goal was to understand how SOC teams monitor, analyze, and respond to security alerts in real time to protect organizations from cyber threats.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore and set up a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool  
- Ingest and analyze simulated security logs  
- Identify suspicious activities such as failed logins, unusual IPs, and malware alerts  
- Classify alerts by severity (High, Medium, Low)  
- Draft a detailed **Incident Response Report**  
- Simulate communication with stakeholders  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Splunk Free Trial** / **Elastic Stack (ELK)** – For log ingestion and alert analysis  
- **Sample Logs** – Authentication logs, network logs, and malware detection alerts  
- **Google Docs / MS Word** – For report writing  
- **Spreadsheets** – For alert classification  

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Set up SIEM**: Configured Splunk/ELK to ingest sample log data  
2. **Log Analysis**: Reviewed authentication, network, and malware detection logs  
3. **Alert Identification**: Detected anomalies such as brute-force attempts and suspicious IPs  
4. **Classification**: Categorized alerts into High, Medium, Low based on impact  
5. **Incident Response**: Created a timeline, analyzed impact, and suggested remediation  
6. **Reporting**: Drafted an **Incident Response Report** with screenshots and findings  

## 📁 Deliverables
- **Incident Response Report (PDF/Doc)**  
- **Screenshots** of analyzed alerts and SIEM dashboard  
- **Alert classification log** (spreadsheet)  
- **Optional:** Draft email communication template  

## 🚀 Skills Gained
- Security alert monitoring  
- Log analysis & triage  
- SIEM dashboards usage  
- Incident classification & escalation  
- Threat communication & reporting  

## 📌 Key Takeaways
This internship project gave me practical exposure to SOC operations, incident response, and SIEM tools. It helped me build a strong foundation for a career in **Cybersecurity & SOC Analysis**.
